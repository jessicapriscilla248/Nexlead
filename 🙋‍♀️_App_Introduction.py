    ### Welcome to the Promotion Employee Predictor!
    
    This app uses a trained CatBoost Classification model to predict whether an employee's `promotion_score` will be **Promoted** or **Not Promoted**,
    based on various operational factors.
    
    Use the sidebar to navigate to the 'Input Data' section to make a prediction, 
    'Results' to view previous prediction results, or 'âž• New Prediction' to make a new prediction.
    
    **About Predictions:**
    This model classifies employees into two categories:
    - **Promoted (1)**: The employee has performed well or above the average performance of others. 
    - **Not promoted (0)**: Employee has a performance that is below the average performance of others.
    
    This can help in identifying employees who may need help in improving their skills, performance, and recognizing high performing employees.
